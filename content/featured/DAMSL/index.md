Paper presented at CVPR 2021 Learning from Limited and Imperfect Data (L2ID) Workshop.

Proposed a novel way to combine score predictions on the support set from fine-tuned feature encoder by constructing an embedding space using a graph neural network. Demonstrated effectiveness of solution over state-of-the-art methods, and the versatility of the solution.
