Oral presentation at the Conference on Digital Experimentation (CODE) 2022 at MIT.

First, we Presented a method to detect if treatment effect variation is present in an experiment, surface the most relevant dimensions for heterogeneity, and characterize the heterogeneity of the estimated individual treatment effects.
