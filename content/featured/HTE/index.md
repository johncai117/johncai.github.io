Oral presentation at the Conference on Digital Experimentation (CODE) 2022 at MIT.

We propose a systematic paradigm for detecting, surfacing and characterizing heterogeneous treatment effects. First, we detect if treatment effect variation is present in an experiment. Second, we surface the most relevant dimensions for heterogeneity. Finally, we characterize the heterogeneity =by studying the conditional distributions of the estimated individual treatment effects.
