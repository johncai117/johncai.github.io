Applied SIFT and ResNet101 for feature extraction and applied a relation network to combine the attribute vector with the image feature vector. Achived a significant increase in accuracy with ResNet101 + Relation Network.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Train Network Reconstruction","tech":["Python","NetworkX","Statsmodel","Matplotlib"],"github":"","external":""},"html":"<p>Reconstructed a real-world train network from entry and exit data using NetworkX. Applied a Weighted MST algorithm to construct a tree, and optimized the algorithm to add back cycles.</p>\n<p>Note: The data is not open, so I am unable to share the code. I am happy, however, to share any insights from this.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Bundle Adjustment for 3D Computer Vision","tech":["Python","Numpy","3D Vision"],"github":"https://github.com/johncai117/bundle-adjust","external":null},"html":"<p>A less code-heavy and more math-heavy project. Bundle adjustment takes a set of parameters to minimize reprojection error of multiple cameras. For efficient code implementation, I utilized a modified Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and exploited the sparse structure of the matrices.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Predicting Economic Recessions using NLP","tech":["Python","MATLAB","BeautifulSoup","Selenium","NLTK","scikit-learn"],"github":"","external":"https://www.academia.edu/40813014/Predicting_Economic_Recessions_using_Natural_Language_Processing"},"html":"<p>Dissertation at Cambridge. Used NLP to study if economic uncertainty can predict recessions. Implemented web-scrapers to retrieve over 300,000 news articles using Selenium/ BeautifulSoup. Quantified uncertainty using MaxEnt models. Invited to publish.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Predicting Business Confidence from Twitter","tech":["Python","BeautifulSoup","Selenium","Twitterscraper","NLTK"],"github":"","external":"https://www.slideshare.net/johncai117/predicting-business-confidence-using-nlp"},"html":"<p>Scraped tweets and news from Trump, CNN and New York Times relating to the economy. Built a preediction model for business confidence using NLTK's Vader sentiment.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Principal Factors behind Measured Gains in Education","tech":["Stata","Econometrics","Causal Inference"],"github":"","external":"https://www.academia.edu/37800063/Principal_factors_behind_measured_gains_in_education_a_natural_experiment_approach"},"html":"<p>Investigated the principal factors behind measured gains in education by exploiting a natural experiment in schooling age. Performed causal inference using instrumental variables and estimated the extra value of a day in school on education outcomes.</p>"}}]}}}
